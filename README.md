## Introduction

This is a simple 2 person website-based chatrooom.
You can register and log in easily by inputting a username and password.

Then go to the Friends page to search for your friend by entering his/her username, then send the friend request.
After your friend accepts your request, then you can start chatting.

You can use `:` plus `word` plus `:` to send emoji as well.
For example, if you input `:smile:`, then press send, you will see a smiley-face emoji in the chat area.

You also can remove your friend simply by pressing the remove button.

On the home page, you can see all your active chat-rooms.
Just click on your friend's username to keep chatting with him/her.

In the chat, you can scroll up to see all the chat history with that friend.
